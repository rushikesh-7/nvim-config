# Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my personal Neovim configuration, optimized for development and productivity. It includes a variety of plugins and settings tailored to my workflow. 

I am using **Lazy.nvim** as the plugin manager for this setup.

## Requirements

Before you start using this configuration, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Neovim**: Version 0.10 or higher is required.
- **Git**: For managing plugins and configurations.
- **Lazy.nvim**: The plugin manager used to install and manage plugins.
- **Nerd Fonts**: Optional, for better UI support (icons, etc.).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   First, clone the repository into your `~/.config/nvim` directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rushikesh-7/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
